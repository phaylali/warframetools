# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 2026-02-01**

Omniversify ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the WarframeTools application.

## 1. Information Collection

### 1.1 Local Data
WarframeTools is an offline-first application. By default, all your relic counter data is stored locally on your device in a private database. We do not have access to this data unless you choose to sync it with our cloud services.

### 1.2 Account Information
If you choose to create an account for cloud sync, we collect:
- **Email Address**: Used for authentication and account recovery.
- **Username**: A display name for your profile.
- **Avatar**: A choice of predefined avatar images.

### 1.3 Cloud Sync Data (Optional)
If you are signed in, the app syncs your relic counts (sparse data) to our PocketBase-powered backend. This data is linked to your account and is used solely to allow you to restore your inventory across different devices.

## 2. Information Usage
We use the information we collect to:
- Provide and maintain the application.
- Authenticate your access to cloud services.
- Synchronize your relic data across your devices.
- Communicate with you regarding account-related issues (e.g., password resets).

## 3. Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage**: Your data remains on your device regardless of whether you have an account.
- **Cloud Storage**: Account and sync data are stored securely on our PocketBase servers.
- **Security**: We implement standard security measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections and secure authentication protocols.

## 4. Information Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Your data is private to your account.

## 5. Your Choices
- **Offline Use**: You can use the app completely offline without creating an account.
- **Data Deletion**: You can delete your account and all associated cloud data via the Settings screen at any time.
- **Local Reset**: You can clear all local data within the app settings.

## 6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our official channels.
